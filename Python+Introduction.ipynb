Python is a very elegant and handy when you want to start your journy as a programmer as it gives you a bunch of modules which are very helpfull.Python is high level,Object-Oriented Programming Language.Unlike other classical Programming Languages python is interpreted (Scripting) Language. Now rather going in the detail of why python is so populer among the Computer Science Community lest dive into it let's have python itself show you why it is so. when you open your terminal and write your first import that will tell you the detail regarding the language. so write below in the terminal after typing 'python' ('command line' in the case of windows operating system). Here, I am using Python 3.5.* and above version. </p>"
